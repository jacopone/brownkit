# Specification Quality Checklist: BrownKit - Spec-Kit Plugin for Legacy Code Remediation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Design Decisions Resolved

✅ **Q1: Auto-commit** → Configurable flag `--auto-commit` (defaults to false)
- Rationale: Respects git control preferences, enables optional automation

✅ **Q2: Thresholds** → Configurable via `.specify/brownfield-config.yaml`
- Rationale: Accommodates legacy system variability, supports incremental improvement

✅ **Q3: Parallel projects** → Yes, multiple numbered projects supported
- Rationale: Matches Spec-Kit pattern, enables team scalability

## Architecture Updates

✅ **Technical Architecture Section Added**:
- Spec-Kit compatibility pattern documented
- Self-contained bash scripts (no external dependencies)
- Data flow diagrams included
- Directory structure mirrors Spec-Kit
- Bash script responsibilities clearly defined

✅ **Self-Contained Design**:
- FR-003 updated: bash scripts directly invoke tools (not wrappers)
- Assumptions updated: removed ai-orchestration dependency
- References updated: quality tools listed explicitly
- Total estimated code: ~520 lines of bash (7 scripts)

## Notes

- ✅ **All requirements validated**: Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
- ✅ **Design decisions documented**: All open questions resolved with rationale
- ✅ **Architecture aligned**: Follows Spec-Kit patterns exactly (slash commands + self-contained bash)
- ✅ **No external dependencies**: Self-contained within brownfield repository
- ✅ **Quality criteria met**: No blockers for planning phase
- All user stories (P0-P1) have independent test criteria
- Edge cases are well-documented with fallback behaviors
