# Specification Quality Checklist: Brownfield-Kit Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Notes

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-centric language focusing on developer workflows (inheriting brownfield codebases, running assessment commands, achieving quality gates). No framework or technology implementation details are mentioned in the spec itself.

2. **No Clarifications Needed**: The specification makes informed guesses based on standard brownfield patterns (Python: src/tests/, JavaScript: src/test/, etc.) and documents these as assumptions. No critical ambiguities remain that would block planning.

3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: All 10 success criteria include quantitative metrics:
   - Time-based: "within 5 minutes", "in under 2 hours"
   - Accuracy-based: "90% of standard project structures", "95% of cases"
   - Coverage-based: "60% coverage on core modules"
   - Quality-based: "reduces violations by 80%"

4. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on user outcomes ("developers can run assessment", "structure remediation moves files") rather than implementation ("uses AST parsing", "implements via Python script").

5. **Complete User Scenarios**: 6 prioritized user stories cover the complete brownfield workflow from assessment (P1) through graduation (P5) and re-entry (P6), each with independent test criteria and acceptance scenarios.

6. **Edge Cases Identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering language detection failures, missing tooling, build breakage, large codebases, interrupted execution, and external dependencies.

7. **Clear Scope**: Dependencies, Assumptions, and Out of Scope sections clearly define boundaries (supports standard languages, requires git/tooling, excludes language migrations and comprehensive refactoring).

**Recommendation**: Specification is complete and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for technical implementation planning.
