# Tasks: BrownKit Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-brownkit-implementation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (‚úì), spec.md (‚úì), research.md (‚úì), data-model.md (‚úì), contracts/ (‚úì)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in the feature specification - tasks focus on implementation only.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/brownfield/`, `tests/` at repository root (Python CLI tool)
- All tasks reference absolute or repo-relative paths

---

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Automated Codebase Assessment (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Detect language, measure baseline metrics, identify tech debt, generate assessment report

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Test Infrastructure Bootstrapping (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Add test framework, generate contract tests, achieve 60% coverage on core modules

**Independent Test**: Run `brownfield testing` on zero-coverage project, verify tests/ directory created, tests pass, coverage ‚â•60%

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Quality Gates Installation (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Install linters, formatters, complexity analysis, pre-commit hooks, fix security issues

**Independent Test**: Run `brownfield quality` on project, verify linter/formatter configs created, pre-commit hooks installed, complexity documented

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [X] T054 [P] [US4] Create quality remediation logic in src/brownfield/remediation/quality.py (install linters, formatters, hooks from plan.md)

---

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Readiness Validation and Graduation (Priority: P5)

**Goal**: Check all 7 readiness gates, compare metrics, generate Speckit constitution, graduate project

**Independent Test**: Run `brownfield validate` on passing project, verify all gates pass; run `brownfield graduate`, verify constitution and graduation report created

- [ ] T070 [US5] Add CLI command imports to src/brownfield/cli/commands.py (import graduate command)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1-5 should all work independently - complete brownfield ‚Üí Speckit transition workflow

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Re-entry for Quality Regression (Priority: P6)

**Goal**: Detect quality regressions (coverage drop, complexity increase, security breach), allow re-entry at appropriate phase

- [ ] T074 [US6] Create re-entry workflow in src/brownfield/orchestrator/phase_machine.py (allow phase restart for graduated projects from constitution.md)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, all user stories should work independently - full lifecycle including quality regression recovery

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **Checkpoint Recovery (Phase 9)**: Can be developed in parallel with user stories
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 (assessment) for practical use
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US2 (structure) for practical use
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US3 (testing) for practical use
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1-4 for practical validation
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US1 and US5 for regression detection

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before CLI commands
- CLI commands before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a phase marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Assessment)

```bash
# Launch all language handlers together:
Task: "Create Python language handler in src/brownfield/plugins/python_handler.py"
Task: "Create JavaScript language handler in src/brownfield/plugins/javascript_handler.py"
Task: "Create Rust language handler in src/brownfield/plugins/rust_handler.py"
Task: "Create Go language handler in src/brownfield/plugins/go_handler.py"

# Launch all assessment components together:
Task: "Create language detector in src/brownfield/assessment/language_detector.py"
Task: "Create metrics collector in src/brownfield/assessment/metrics_collector.py"
Task: "Create tech debt analyzer in src/brownfield/assessment/tech_debt_analyzer.py"
Task: "Create report generator in src/brownfield/assessment/report_generator.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Assessment)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test `brownfield assess` on multiple fixture projects
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Assessment)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Structure) - can start models/logic
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Testing) - can start models/logic
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
- Tests are NOT included per feature specification - focus is on implementation only
- Follow constitution principles: incremental remediation, transparent reasoning, reversibility
